I am currently following the Foundations learning course from The Odin Project which has been of great help to me. I learned how to add text and images to an html file as well as change some fonts using anchor elements and changing sizes of images. This projects goal was to create a recipe index.html file and have the links on that file take the user to pages in which the recipe (ingredients, steps, description, and images) is layed out to the user.
